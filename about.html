    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Ashraya Trust is a non-profit organization dedicated to uplifting rural communities through compassion, empowerment, and sustainable development. We work to improve healthcare access by conducting medical camps in villages, promote dry land development to enhance livelihoods, and empower women through self-help groups and tailoring programs. Each year, we also award scholarships to top-performing students in rural villages, encouraging education and excellence among the youth. At Ashraya Trust, we believe in nurturing potential, fostering self-reliance, and creating opportunities for a brighter, more equitable future.</p>
